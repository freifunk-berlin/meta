# Hardware orders Stadtfunk

_Explanation of hardware ordering process by [Stadtfunk](https://stadtfunk.net/)._

2023 Budget: **6.000‚Ç¨**

---

## Procedure

### Request

To request new hardware you have to create an [Issue](#). Use the template to enter the necessary information. Check first if one of the [other options](#other-options) for hardware procurement makes more sense and use one of the [preferred-vendors](#preferred-shops) if possible.

### Decision

The decision about accepting hardware requests is made by the active people from the community. Specifically, this means everyone who is part of the organization [Freifunk-Berlin](https://github.com/orgs/freifunk-berlin/people) on Github. A maximum budget of 12,000‚Ç¨ can be spent per year, the current balance is documented in this document. The decision should mainly consider the benefit for the expansion of a stable network. Discussions about the requests can be made in the comments of the issue, or on the [Freifunk meetings](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Treffen).

As soon as there are two approvals (üëç) on the issue, it is accepted. If there is not enough approval after one month, or there were two rejections (üëé), the request will be rejected.

The [Stadtfunk-Team](#stadtfunk-team) reserves the right to refuse requests regardless of the decision if they do not meet the purpose of the non-profit status of the gGmbH.

### Waiting time

Once a week the issues are reviewed by the [Stadtfunk-Team](#stadtfunk-team). Some requests can be fulfilled directly because the products are in [stock](#). New purchases are not made every week, but rather multiple orders are attempted to be placed together. Additionally, it is dependent on vendor availability and delivery capabilities.
The current state of the process is commented in the issues and represented by the [labels](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/meta/labels) in the issue:

- Accepted
- Rejected
- Need for discussion
- Completed

### Issue

The confirmed hardware can always be picked up on tuesday afternoons at the Stadtfunk office (Kirchhofstr. 45, 12055 Neuk√∂lln). Alternatively, an extra appointment can be made, contact the [Stadtfunk team](#stadtfunk-team) for this.

## Other options

It is not always necessary to order new devices. In the [freifunk-room](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Standorte:Haus-der-Statistik#Freifunk_Berlin_im_Haus_der_Statistik) there is a collection of old devices that can be used for free. It's best to look there first to see if you can find something suitable. Use the [regular meetings](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Treffen) or ask in the [chat](https://matrix.to/#/#berlin.freifunk.net:matrix.org).

## Preferred shops

When looking for new products, it makes sense to look preferably at these suppliers. With these there was already experience at Stadtfunk, or there are already accounts, which makes the ordering process easier. If there is a significantly cheaper offer elsewhere, that is of course also good to know.

Liebe Freifunkis,

seit fast zwei Jahren kaufen wir bei Stadtfunk Hardware ein und geben diese an die Community weiter. Bisher wurde das ganze im direkten Kontakt gekl√§rt und es gab keinen formalen Ablauf. Das w√ºrden wir gerne √§ndern, indem wir einen transparenten und community basierten Entscheidungsprozess einf√ºhren. Daf√ºr haben wir ein Konzept geschrieben, das ihr hier im Anhang und im Meta Repository¬π bei Freifunk-Berlin findet. 

Gebt uns gerne Feedback dazu, wie ihr das neue Konzept findet. In einigen Monaten w√ºrden wir das ganze gerne nochmal auswerten.

Mit solidarischen Gr√º√üen
Lino // Stadtfunk

Dear Freifunkis,

for almost two years we have been buying hardware from Stadtfunk and passing it on to the community. Until now, the whole thing was clarified in direct contact and there was no formal process. We would like to change that by introducing a transparent and community based decision making process. We have written a concept for this, which you can find here in the attachment and in the meta repository¬π at Freifunk-Berlin. 

Feel free to give us feedback on what you think of the new concept. In a few months we would like to evaluate the whole thing again.

With solidarity greetings
Lino // Stadtfunk
